# vocab-training

This is a simple vocabulary training app implemented in Java. It has a functional GUI and essentially works the same way as Rosetta Stone, Duolingo, and other popular foreign language learning apps: the user is presented with a picture, and must produce the corresponding word in the target language to continue. Incorrect or skipped prompts are repeated at the end.
Some sample data in Korean and Portuguese is included.
